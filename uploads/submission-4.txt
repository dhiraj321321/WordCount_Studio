Functional Frontend: A complete user interface was developed using React, featuring 
reusable components, client-side routing via react-router-dom, and state management 
through the Context API (AuthContext, TrainContext). Key functionalities realized include 
user registration, login, train searching, displaying search results, booking ticket forms 
with passenger details, viewing booking/complaint/food order history, and an 
administrative panel for train management. Dynamic elements, such as the conditional 
display of the in-train service dashboard and modals for service requests, were 
implemented. sessionStorage was successfully used to persist search results, enhancing 
user experience during navigation. 
2. Secure Backend API: A robust RESTful API was built using Spring Boot, exposing endpoints 
for all required functionalities. Spring Security was implemented to secure the API, 
utilizing JWT for stateless authentication. Public endpoints were correctly configured, 
while protected endpoints require valid JWTs, processed by a custom JwtAuthFilter. Role
based access control effectively restricts administrative functions (@PreAuthorize) to 
users with the 'ADMIN' role. Password encoding (BCryptPasswordEncoder) ensures 
secure storage of user credentials. CORS was configured to allow communication 
specifically from the frontend application. 
3. Data Persistence and Management: Spring Data JPA and Hibernate successfully managed 
data persistence with the PostgreSQL database. Entities accurately mapped to database 
tables, including handling bidirectional relationships (e.g., FoodOrder and 
FoodOrderItem). Repositories provided a clean abstraction layer for database operations. 
Hibernate's ddl-auto=update feature facilitated rapid schema evolution during 
development. 
4. Successful Integration: The frontend and backend were successfully integrated. Axios, 
configured with an interceptor, seamlessly handled API requests, including the automatic 
attachment of JWT tokens for authenticated calls. Data transfer formats (JSON, DTOs) 
were consistent between the client and server.
